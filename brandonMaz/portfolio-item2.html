            <p>This project was a first for a lot of things for me. It was the first time I was able to create an API, which turned into a searchable API. The reason for that is because I wanted to be able to search for a product by its name. It was also a first using Bootstrap as my front-end.</p>

            <p>I came into this project knowing what I wanted to do and how I wanted to style it. It came out better than I expected because I put more time into the concept and layout of the project. I ended up doing a home page with with two index pages. I also separated all of my css into different files, which made making changes to one specific page easier and didn't interfere with the rest of the pages that had the same layout. I wanted the search bar to work for my webpage, thinking it was going to be an easy plug the syntax and bingo. Come to find out it was not that simple, and in fact I had to install lodash, along with writing a whole new line of code. I had a lot of fun getting it to work so that I can have a searchable API.</p>
